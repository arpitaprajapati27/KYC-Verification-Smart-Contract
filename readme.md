# KYC Verification Smart Contract

## Project Title
KYC Verification Smart Contract

## Project Description
This smart contract implements a basic Know Your Customer (KYC) system on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows an administrator to register users and verify their identity, ensuring that only verified users can be authenticated for future decentralized services.

## Project Vision
To establish a secure and decentralized method for identity verification using blockchain technology, reducing reliance on centralized systems and enabling faster, more transparent onboarding processes across dApps.

## Key Features
- *Admin-Based Registration*: Only an authorized administrator can add and verify users.
- *Immutable Verification Record*: Once verified, a user's status is publicly accessible on the blockchain.
- *Simplicity and Efficiency*: Contains only essential functions for ease of use and integration.

## Future Scope
- Add multi-admin support and role-based access control.
- Enable users to upload hash proofs of documents (IPFS).
- Implement events for transparency and real-time tracking.
- Integrate with external identity providers or KYC services via oracles.
- Expand to support revocation and re-verification of users.
